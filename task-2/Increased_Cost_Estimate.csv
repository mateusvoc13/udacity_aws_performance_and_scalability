"* AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services."

Here is the rationale for using the larger budget.
 - More performance:
   - Larger number of application and web servers;
   - Larger database servers;
 - Backups:
   - Two S3 buckets for backup: 1 ready for production load (in a different region)
   and 1 at Glacier.
