#+TITLE: Social Media Application - Infrastructure Costs
#+author: Mateus Costa
#+description: AWS Cloud Architect - Project 2 - Task 2 - Scenario 1

  Here we present you the ~infrastructure costs~ for a social media application.

  First, here are the system requirements:
  - 50,000 monthly users;
  - Region: us-east-1;
  - Infrastructure elements:
    - One VPC, Two AZs and 4 subnets (2 Public, 2 Private);
    - A NAT Gateway;
    - Cloudfront distribution;
    - S3 Bucket;
    - Web and Application Servers (EC2);
    - DB Servers (RDS Aurora).

  Financially, this application should have a monthly spend between $8,000 and
  $10,000, initially, and be prepared to move to $6,500 in hard times and to
  $20,000 if the application is a success.

  In terms of load, we expect that:
  - Each user has an average of 1GB of static data stored---total 50TB stored in
    S3;
  - Each user has an average of 100MB of database data stored---total of 5TB
    stored in RDS;
  - Each user transfers an average of 1GB of data per month---total 50TB
    transferred (mostly static files);
  - 30% of the users (15,000 people) are online most of the time (90%);

  We are assuming that:
  - Every 1000 users will required 8GB of RAM and 2 CPU Core;
    - This means:
      - 120 GB of RAM and 30 CPUs with the average load;
      - 400 GB of RAM and 100 CPUs with the highest load (100% of users).

** Scenario 1 - $8,000-$10,000

   - Total Cost: 8,995.04 USD
     - VPC: 526.50 USD
     - Aurora: 3,767.80 USD
     - Load Balancing: 393.38 USD
     - EC2: 3,129.76 USD
     - S3: 1,177.60 USD

*** VPC
**** NAT Gateway, Subnet, AZs
     - 2 NAT Gateways with 2.5 TB/Month per year
*** S3
    - 50TB Stored
    - Served by Cloudfront
*** EC2 (Application and Web Servers)
**** Regular Load
     - 8 a1.metal web servers (16 vCPUs, 32GiB)
     - 8 a1.metal application servers (16 vCPUs, 32GiB)
**** Load balance
     - 4 application load balancers with 5 TB per month of processed bytes
*** RDS Aurora(Database Servers)
**** Master and Read Replica
     - 2 Instances
     - 5 TB per month per instance
     - 16 vCPUs/122 GIB

** Scenario 2 - Reduced Cost Estimate - $6,500

   For this scenario, we are assuming that the data that is stored and will be
   transferred won't be affected and that the cost reduction will come from
   penalties in the system performance. For this reason, the machines that are
   serving the system will be downsized.

   - Total Cost: 8,995.04 USD
     - VPC: 526.50 USD
     - Aurora: 2,672.80 USD
     - Load Balancing: 393.38 USD
     - EC2: 1,564.88 USD
     - S3: 1,177.60 USD

*** VPC
**** NAT Gateway, Subnet, AZs
     - 2 NAT Gateways with 2.5 TB per month
*** S3
    - 50TB Stored
    - Served by Cloudfront
*** EC2 (Application and Web Servers)
**** Regular Load
     - 4 a1.metal web servers (16 vCPUs, 32GiB)
     - 4 a1.metal application servers (16 vCPUs, 32GiB)
**** Load balance
     - 4 application load balancers with 5 TB per month of processed bytes
*** RDS Aurora(Database Servers)
**** Master and Read Replica
     - 2 Instances
     - 5 TB per month per instance
     - 8 vCPUs/61 GIB

** Scenario 3 - $18,000-$20,000

   For Scenario 3, the larger budget will allow:
   - More performance:
     - Larger number of application and web servers;
     - Larger database servers;
   - Backups:
     - Two S3 buckets for backup: 1 ready for production load (in a different
       region) and 1 at Glacier.

*** VPC
**** NAT Gateway, Subnet, AZs
     - 2 NAT Gateways with 2.5 TB/Month per year
*** S3
    - 3 instances (2 Standard and 1 Glacier);
    - 50TB Stored at each;
    - Served by Cloudfront.
*** EC2 (Application and Web Servers)
**** Regular Load
     - 18 a1.metal web servers (16 vCPUs, 32GiB)
     - 18 a1.metal application servers (16 vCPUs, 32GiB)
**** Load balance
     - 4 application load balancers with 50 TB per month of processed bytes
*** RDS Aurora(Database Servers)
**** Master and Read Replica
     - 2 Instances
     - 5 TB per month per instance
     - 32 vCPUs/244 GIB
